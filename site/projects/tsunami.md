# Tsunami

A command-line utility for killing processes listening on specific network ports. Run it without arguments for an interactive TUI, or pass port numbers directly.

```bash
tsunami 3000        # kill process on port 3000
tsunami 3000 8080   # kill multiple
tsunami -f 3000     # force, no confirmation
```
