# Tsunami

Tsunami is a command-line utility for killing processes listening on specific network ports. Written in Go, it makes port management fast and simple.

## The Problem

During development, you often need to free up a port. Maybe a crashed server left a zombie process, or you need to restart a service on port 3000. The usual approach involves multiple commands: `lsof`, parsing output, extracting PIDs, then `kill`.

Tsunami reduces this to one command.

## How It Works

Run `tsunami` without arguments for an interactive terminal UI. Browse running processes, filter by name or port, and kill what you need.

Or target ports directly:

```bash
# Kill whatever is on port 3000
tsunami 3000

# Kill multiple ports
tsunami 3000 8080 5432

# Force kill without confirmation
tsunami -f 3000
```

## Features

- Interactive TUI with filtering
- Direct port targeting via arguments
- Configurable signals (TERM, KILL, INT)
- Confirmation prompts with force-kill bypass
- Quiet mode for scripts
- Works on macOS and Linux
