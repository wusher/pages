# Install

Getting Medusa running on your system takes just a few commands. The generator itself is a Python package, with Tailwind CSS handling the styling pipeline.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Tailwind CSS Setup

Medusa uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Install the CLI globally or as a project dependency:

```bash
# Global installation
npm install -g tailwindcss

# Or per-project (recommended for teams)
npm install -D tailwindcss
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** - Medusa uses modern Python features for cleaner code
- **Tailwind CLI** - Must be available on your PATH for CSS compilation
- **Node.js** - Required for npm and the Tailwind CLI

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check Medusa is available
medusa --help

# Check Tailwind is accessible
npx tailwindcss --help
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tailwind not found

If builds fail with Tailwind errors, ensure the CLI is in your PATH:

```bash
# Check if Tailwind is accessible
which tailwindcss

# Or use npx to run it
npx tailwindcss --help
```

### Python version issues

Medusa requires Python 3.10 or higher. Check your version:

```bash
python --version
```

Consider using `pyenv` or `conda` to manage multiple Python versions if your system default is older.

### Permission errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation, consider using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```
