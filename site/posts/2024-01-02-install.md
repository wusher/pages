# Install

Getting Medusa running on your system takes just a few commands. The generator itself is a Python package available on PyPI, with Tailwind CSS handling the styling pipeline.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install medusa-ssg
```

## Tailwind CSS Setup

Medusa uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Install the CLI as a project dependency:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography terser
```

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin provides beautiful prose styling for your content, and `terser` handles JavaScript minification.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** - Medusa uses modern Python features
- **Node.js** - Required for npm and the Tailwind CLI
- **Tailwind CLI** - Must be available for CSS compilation

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check Medusa is available
medusa --help

# Check Tailwind is accessible
npx tailwindcss --help
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tailwind not found

If builds fail with Tailwind errors, ensure the CLI is installed:

```bash
# Install Tailwind and plugins
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography

# Verify installation
npx tailwindcss --help
```

### Python version issues

Medusa requires Python 3.10 or higher. Check your version:

```bash
python --version
```

Consider using `pyenv` or `conda` to manage multiple Python versions if your system default is older.

### Permission errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation, consider using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install medusa-ssg
```
