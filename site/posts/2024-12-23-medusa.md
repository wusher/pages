# Medusa

Medusa is a lightweight static site generator built with Python. It prioritizes simplicity and speed, letting you focus on content rather than configuration.

## Why I Built It

Most static site generators require verbose frontmatter, complex plugin systems, and extensive configuration. I wanted something that just works. Write Markdown, run a command, get a website.

## Key Features

**Markdown-First** - Write content in Markdown with automatic metadata extraction. Dates and slugs come from filenames, titles from headings. No frontmatter required.

**Jinja2 Templating** - Build layouts using Jinja2's powerful templating system. Access content through intuitive globals like `pages`, `tags`, and `data`.

**Tailwind CSS Built-In** - The CSS pipeline compiles only the classes you use. No extra configuration needed.

**Live Reload** - The dev server watches for changes and refreshes your browser instantly.

**Automatic Generation** - Sitemap and RSS feeds are generated during builds. Pretty URLs keep links clean.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install medusa-ssg
medusa new mysite
cd mysite
medusa serve
```
