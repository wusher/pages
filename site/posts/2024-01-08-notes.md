# Notes

Important details and edge cases to keep in mind when working with Medusa.

## Draft Content

Files and directories prefixed with `_` are treated as drafts. This applies to both individual files and entire directories:

```
site/
  posts/
    _2024-01-20-work-in-progress.md  # Draft post
    2024-01-15-published.md          # Published post
  _drafts/                           # Entire directory of drafts
    idea-1.md
    idea-2.md
```

Drafts are excluded from:
- Production builds (`medusa build`)
- Sitemap generation
- RSS feeds
- Page collections in templates

Include drafts during development with the `--drafts` flag:

```bash
medusa serve --drafts
medusa build --drafts
```

## Image Handling

Medusa automatically rewrites relative image paths in Markdown and Jinja templates. Images referenced with relative paths are resolved to `/assets/images/...` in the output.

### Markdown Images

```markdown
![Photo](../assets/images/photo.jpg)
```

Becomes:

```html
<img src="/assets/images/photo.jpg" alt="Photo">
```

### Template Images

Use `url_for()` for explicit control:

```jinja
<img src="{{ url_for('assets/images/photo.jpg') }}">
```

## New Project Dependencies

When you run `medusa new`, the generated project includes a `package.json` with:

- `tailwindcss` - CSS framework and compiler
- `terser` - JavaScript minifier

If `npm` is available, `medusa new` runs `npm install` automatically. Otherwise, install dependencies manually:

```bash
cd mysite
npm install
```

Both tools must be available for full build functionality:
- Tailwind compiles your CSS
- Terser minifies JavaScript for production

## Pretty URLs

Medusa generates clean URLs by default:

| Source | Output |
|--------|--------|
| `about.md` | `/about/index.html` → `/about/` |
| `posts/hello.md` | `/posts/hello/index.html` → `/posts/hello/` |

This means links like `/about/` work without file extensions.

## Date Parsing

Dates are extracted from filenames in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`:

```
2024-01-15-my-post.md  →  date: 2024-01-15, slug: my-post
```

If no date is in the filename, Medusa uses the file modification time.

## Template Resolution

Layouts and partials are resolved from:
1. `site/_layouts/` for page layouts
2. `site/_partials/` for included components

The default layout is `default.html.jinja`. Override it per-page by adding a layout declaration or placing content in a subdirectory with its own layout.

## Build Output

The `output/` directory is completely rebuilt on each `medusa build`. Never edit files there directly. Your changes will be lost.

For deployment, point your web server or hosting platform at the `output/` directory.
