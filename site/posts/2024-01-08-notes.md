# Notes

- Drafts are files prefixed with `_` (directories or filenames) and are excluded unless `--drafts` is used.
- Image paths in Markdown/Jinja are rewritten to `/assets/images/...` for relative sources.
- New projects include `package.json` with `tailwindcss` and `terser`. `medusa new` will run `npm install` if `npm` is available; otherwise run it yourself to get the CLI tools.
