# Volcano

I wanted to turn a folder of markdown files into a website. That's it. No YAML configs, no theme scaffolding, no frontmatter requirements. Just point at a directory and get a site.

## The Problem with Existing Tools

Every static site generator I tried wanted something from me before I could see results. Jekyll needs a `_config.yml`, specific folder conventions, and frontmatter on every file. Hugo has powerful features buried under layers of configuration. Even "simple" generators assume you'll spend time on setup before writing.

I have markdown files. Hundreds of them. Notes from Obsidian, documentation for projects, ideas scattered across folders. The structure already exists in my file system. Why should I translate that into someone else's config format?

## Folder Structure Is Site Structure

Volcano treats your directory layout as the source of truth. A folder becomes a section. A file becomes a page. Nested folders become nested navigation. The hierarchy you already created while organizing your thoughts becomes the hierarchy visitors see.

No configuration file maps routes. No frontmatter declares parent pages. The file system handles all of that.

## Wiki Links Just Work

Obsidian users link between notes with `[[Page Name]]` syntax. Most generators choke on this or require plugins. Volcano resolves wiki-style links automatically, so an existing vault publishes without modification.

This matters because notes written for personal use shouldn't need transformation before sharing. The friction of reformatting kills the motivation to publish.

## What You Get Without Asking

Volcano includes features that usually require plugins or configuration elsewhere:

- Full-text search via command palette
- Table of contents generated from headings
- Automatic sitemap and meta tags
- Dark mode that follows system preferences
- Mobile-responsive navigation

These exist because a published site should have them. Making authors opt-in to basics like search feels backwards.

## Single Binary, No Dependencies

Volcano compiles to one executable. No Node.js, no Python, no Ruby version management. Download the binary for your platform and run it. This removes an entire category of "it works on my machine" problems.
