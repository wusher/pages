      <h1>Happy</h1>
<p>Sometimes the smallest things bring the most joy. A working build after hours of debugging. Clean code that finally clicks into place. The satisfaction of a well-structured project.</p>
<h2>Finding Joy in Development</h2>
<p>Software development is often described in terms of problem-solving and productivity. But there's an overlooked dimension: the simple happiness that comes from creating something that works.</p>
<p>When you run <code>medusa build</code> and see your site come together, when your templates render perfectly, when your content flows exactly as intended—that's a moment worth appreciating.</p>
<h2>Small Wins Matter</h2>
<p>Not every project needs to change the world. Sometimes building a personal blog, documenting a hobby, or sharing thoughts with a small audience is enough. The act of creation itself has value.</p>
<p>A few things that make development enjoyable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clean architecture</strong> - Code that reads like prose and functions like clockwork</li>
<li><strong>Fast feedback loops</strong> - Live reload that shows changes instantly</li>
<li><strong>Simple tools</strong> - Software that does one thing well without unnecessary complexity</li>
<li><strong>Finished projects</strong> - The rare satisfaction of calling something complete</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Present Moment</h2>
<p>The best time to start is now. Not when conditions are perfect, not when you have more time, not when you've learned that one more thing. Now.</p>
<p>Write that first post. Build that simple site. Ship something small and iterate.</p>
<p>Progress compounds. Each small step forward creates momentum for the next. Before you know it, you've built something meaningful—not because of any single grand gesture, but because of consistent, small acts of creation.</p>
<h2>Stay Curious</h2>
<p>Keep experimenting. Try new approaches. Break things and fix them. The learning never stops, and that's part of what makes this field endlessly interesting.</p>
<p>Here's to the joy of building, one commit at a time.</p>
