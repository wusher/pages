        <h1 id="volcano">Volcano</h1>
<p>I wanted to turn a folder of markdown files into a website. That's it. No YAML configs, no theme scaffolding, no frontmatter requirements. Just point at a directory and get a site.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-existing-tools">The Problem with Existing Tools</h2>
<p>Every static site generator I tried wanted something from me before I could see results. Jekyll needs a <code>_config.yml</code>, specific folder conventions, and frontmatter on every file. Hugo has powerful features buried under layers of configuration. Even &quot;simple&quot; generators assume you'll spend time on setup before writing.</p>
<p>I have markdown files. Hundreds of them. Notes from Obsidian, documentation for projects, ideas scattered across folders. The structure already exists in my file system. Why should I translate that into someone else's config format?</p>
<h2 id="folder-structure-is-site-structure">Folder Structure Is Site Structure</h2>
<p>Volcano treats your directory layout as the source of truth. A folder becomes a section. A file becomes a page. Nested folders become nested navigation. The hierarchy you already created while organizing your thoughts becomes the hierarchy visitors see.</p>
<p>No configuration file maps routes. No frontmatter declares parent pages. The file system handles all of that.</p>
<h2 id="wiki-links-just-work">Wiki Links Just Work</h2>
<p>Obsidian users link between notes with <code>[[Page Name]]</code> syntax. Most generators choke on this or require plugins. Volcano resolves wiki-style links automatically, so an existing vault publishes without modification.</p>
<p>This matters because notes written for personal use shouldn't need transformation before sharing. The friction of reformatting kills the motivation to publish.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-get-without-asking">What You Get Without Asking</h2>
<p>Volcano includes features that usually require plugins or configuration elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-text search via command palette</li>
<li>Table of contents generated from headings</li>
<li>Automatic sitemap and meta tags</li>
<li>Dark mode that follows system preferences</li>
<li>Mobile-responsive navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>These exist because a published site should have them. Making authors opt-in to basics like search feels backwards.</p>
<h2 id="single-binary-no-dependencies">Single Binary, No Dependencies</h2>
<p>Volcano compiles to one executable. No Node.js, no Python, no Ruby version management. Download the binary for your platform and run it. This removes an entire category of &quot;it works on my machine&quot; problems.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
